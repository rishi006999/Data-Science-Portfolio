Semester: Fall 2023

Project Summary:
This project explores the thematic structure, emotional tone, and misinformation trends in Republican Presidential Primary debates. 
We leveraged advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to uncover hidden insights from debate transcripts.

The project applied:
- BERTopic for personalized topic modeling across candidates
- Transformer-based models for sentiment analysis
- TF-IDF vectorization combined with SVM classifiers for misinformation detection

Our approach provided insights into debate dynamics, candidate rhetoric, emotional engagement strategies, and honesty trends in political communication.

Main Files:
